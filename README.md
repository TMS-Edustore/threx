1. Using Windows APIs for Process Management
Detect and Close Applications: You can use the Windows API to list running processes and close any that aren’t related to the study application. For example, you can use Process Explorer to find and terminate processes by their names or PIDs (Process IDs).
PowerShell or Command-Line Integration: You can integrate PowerShell or use command-line commands within Flutter (via platform channels) to manage processes. For example, commands like taskkill can close applications:
shell
Copy code
taskkill /F /IM <application_name>.exe
Platform Channels in Flutter: Since Flutter doesn’t natively support process management, you can use platform channels to call native Windows code (C++/C#) or PowerShell scripts to handle these tasks. For example:
Write a C++ or C# codebase that interfaces with Windows API for process management.
Use platform channels to call these functions from Flutter.
2. Creating a Kiosk Mode
Restricting to One Application: To ensure only the study application is open and accessible, you would need to create a kiosk-like environment:
Disable Task Manager: This will prevent students from opening the Task Manager to close the study application. This can be done using registry edits or Group Policy.
Prevent Other Programs from Opening: You can monitor the system for any new processes and immediately terminate them if they are not the allowed study application.
Disable Alt+Tab, Windows Key, etc.: These keys can be intercepted and blocked to prevent students from switching out of the study application.
3. System-Level Permissions
To enforce these restrictions, your application will need administrator-level permissions. This will allow the application to:
Close other programs.
Restrict access to certain parts of the operating system (like Task Manager, File Explorer, etc.).
4. Parental Control API or Group Policy
You might also explore parental control APIs or Windows Group Policy to enforce application restrictions and manage which programs can be accessed.
5. User Experience and Safety
Ensure that the study application is user-friendly, and there is a way for administrators (teachers) to unlock the system for maintenance or if any issues arise.
Be mindful of not interrupting important background processes needed for Windows or networking.


To ensure your Flutter desktop application launches on startup and users can't easily stop or remove that behavior (even if they remove it from startup apps), you'll need to implement a few strategies. Here’s how you can achieve that:

1. Launching the Application on Startup
You can make your application launch on startup using one of the following methods:

Windows Registry Method: Add an entry to the Windows Registry to start your application automatically upon system boot:

bash
Copy code
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
You can write to this registry key programmatically in Flutter using platform channels.

Example:

The entry should include the path to your application’s executable file.
Example C++ code (called via platform channels):
cpp
Copy code
#include <windows.h>

void addToStartup() {
  HKEY hKey;
  RegOpenKey(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run", &hKey);
  RegSetValueEx(hKey, "YourAppName", 0, REG_SZ, (BYTE*)"<PathToYourApp.exe>", sizeof("<PathToYourApp.exe>"));
  RegCloseKey(hKey);
}
Shortcut in Startup Folder: Alternatively, place a shortcut to your application in the Windows Startup folder:

bash
Copy code
C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
You can do this programmatically as well, by copying a shortcut of your app to this folder during installation or first run.

2. Preventing Users from Removing the App from Startup
Users might remove the app from startup via settings or Task Manager. To counteract this, you can implement a few tricks:

Monitoring the Registry Key/Startup Folder:

Write a background service or a secondary process that continuously monitors whether the startup entry exists in the registry or Startup folder. If it gets removed, the service will automatically add it back.
This service can be a Windows service or another process that runs with elevated permissions.
Example Process:

Write a script or a small daemon that runs in the background to monitor the startup registry key or the Startup folder.
If the entry gets deleted or modified, the service will recreate it.
Run as a System Service:

You can create a Windows Service that launches your app. Windows services are more difficult for users to disable compared to startup entries in Task Manager.
The service runs with higher privileges, and users won’t have the typical control over it. A Flutter app can start with the service at system boot.
3. Blocking Task Manager or Access to Startup Settings
Disable Task Manager: This can prevent users from stopping the application or removing it from the startup list.

Modify the registry to disable Task Manager:
bash
Copy code
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
Create a new DWORD value named DisableTaskMgr and set it to 1 to disable Task Manager.
Restrict Access to Startup Settings: You can restrict access to the Startup settings or Task Manager using Windows Group Policy or Registry modifications. However, you must ensure the system's integrity remains intact.

4. Admin Privileges for Startup Control
Your application will need administrator privileges to modify registry keys, manage the startup folder, and perform other system-level actions.
Ensure the application is installed and run with elevated privileges so it can enforce the startup behavior.
5. Persistence After Removal
In case the user manages to remove the startup entry or uninstall the application, you could implement:
A hidden background service that re-installs or restores the startup behavior.
An additional monitoring process that checks the existence of the app on startup and reinstates it if removed.
Steps Overview:
Launch on Startup:

Use the Windows Registry or Startup folder to launch the app.
Make sure the app has a monitoring mechanism to re-add itself if removed.
Restrict User Access:

Disable Task Manager or Startup Settings if feasible to limit user ability to interfere with the startup configuration.
Elevated Permissions:

Run the app with administrator privileges to ensure system-level actions can be performed.
